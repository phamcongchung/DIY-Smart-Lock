OVERVIEW:
This repository contains the source code, simulation, and documentation for my homemade Atmega smart lock project.
The project aims to create a secure and customizable smart lock system using Atmega microcontrollers.

FEATURES:
- Key Entry: The lock provides the traditional key entry system for a simple and low-cost system.
- Password Protection: The lock supports a password-based authentication system for security.
- Password Settings: The system allows users to customize passwords with simple operation.
- Low Power Consumption: The design emphasizes energy efficiency, ensuring extended battery life for the smart lock.

DOCUMENTATION:
Refer to the 'docs' directory for detailed documentation, including system architecture, wiring diagrams, and user guides.

NOTES:
A working Arduino might be needed for microcontroller bootloader burning.
New upgrades will be updated in the future.
